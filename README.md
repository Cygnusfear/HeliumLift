# Helium Lift
Helium Lift is a revamp of Jaden Geller's floating browser window, Helium. Watch media, browse the web and do much more while you stay productive. Your content will never fall behind your other windows even as you switch tasks. Helium supports a customizable translucency mode that allows you to simultaneously see your content and your work, without intercepting mouse clicks when it's translucent. You have the ability to click, drag, scroll behind your floating content. 

Quickly launch popular streaming services such as Netflix, Steamnation, or Plex right from the home screen or use the Chrome Extension to fling web pages right from your browser to Helium Lift.
